# ScrapingBee Testing Results

## Summary

After extensive testing with ScrapingBee, we found that while the service can partially bypass Cloudflare protection on Mexican real estate sites, it still faces significant challenges in retrieving actual property listings.

## Test Results

### Configuration 3: Without Stealth Mode (Best Result)
- **Status**: Partial Success
- **Response Size**: 740KB
- **Credits Used**: 25
- **Findings**:
  - Cloudflare challenge still detected
  - Retrieved 28 "tile" elements (mostly publisher/developer containers)
  - Found 144 price elements and 91 location elements
  - Only 3 property URLs found (all development projects)
  - Most content appears to be promotional/developer information rather than individual listings

### Failed Configurations
1. **Custom Headers + User Agent**: 400 error
2. **JavaScript Scenario with Human Behavior**: 400 error  
3. **Mobile User Agent**: 400 error

## Key Insights

1. **Counter-intuitive Success**: Disabling stealth mode (`stealth_proxy: false`) actually worked better than enabling it
2. **Limited Content**: Even when successful, we're getting publisher/developer tiles rather than individual property listings
3. **High Credit Cost**: 25 credits per request is expensive for limited results
4. **Cloudflare Still Active**: The challenge is still present even in "successful" requests

## Implementation

The property scraper has been updated to:
1. Try ScrapingBee first if `SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY` is set in environment
2. Fall back to Scrape.do if ScrapingBee fails or returns insufficient content
3. Use the working configuration (no stealth mode) for Vivanuncios

## Recommendations

1. **Cost Analysis**: At 25 credits per request with limited results, ScrapingBee may not be cost-effective for production use
2. **Alternative Approach**: Consider:
   - Direct API partnerships with real estate platforms
   - Building relationships with data providers
   - Using EasyBroker as the primary data source (already working well)
3. **Development Focus**: Rather than fighting anti-scraping measures, focus on:
   - Improving the EasyBroker integration
   - Adding more API-based sources
   - Building a robust data aggregation pipeline

## Next Steps

1. Continue using EasyBroker as the primary reliable data source
2. Monitor ScrapingBee usage and costs carefully if deployed
3. Investigate official APIs or data partnerships with Mexican real estate platforms
4. Consider the custom solution approach if scraping becomes critical
