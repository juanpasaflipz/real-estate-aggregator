# Pulppo.com Scraping Summary

## Overview
Pulppo.com is a Mexican real estate platform that is **scrapable** with the right approach.

## Key Findings

### ✅ Positive Aspects
1. **No Cloudflare Protection**: Unlike Vivanuncios and Inmuebles24, Pulppo doesn't use Cloudflare
2. **No CAPTCHA**: No captcha challenges detected
3. **Accessible with Scrape.do**: Your Scrape.do token successfully accesses the site
4. **Clear robots.txt**: Allows all user agents (`User-agent: * Allow: /`)

### ⚠️ Challenges
1. **Next.js Application**: Pulppo is built with Next.js and loads property data dynamically
2. **Client-Side Rendering**: Properties are loaded via JavaScript after initial page load
3. **No Server-Side Properties**: The initial HTML doesn't contain property listings

## Technical Details

### Site Structure
- Built with Next.js
- Uses server-side rendering for SEO but loads properties client-side
- Property URLs follow pattern: `/propiedad/[property-id]`
- Search URLs are SEO-friendly slugs: `/propiedades-venta-ciudad-de-mexico`

### Data Loading
The site loads an initial page with:
- Page metadata
- Search filters configuration
- Empty property container

Properties are then loaded via API calls after the page renders.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed
1. Created `PulppoScraper` class in `/src/scrapers/pulppo-scraper.ts`
2. Added Pulppo support to `PropertyScraper` service
3. Integrated into REST API endpoints
4. Configured Scrape.do token in environment

### Current Approach
Using Scrape.do with JavaScript rendering enabled:
```javascript
await scrapeDoService.scrape({
  url: 'https://pulppo.com/propiedades-venta-ciudad-de-mexico',
  render: true,
  waitUntil: 'networkidle2',
  geoCode: 'mx'
});
```

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. **Monitor Success Rate**: Since properties load dynamically, success may vary
2. **Consider Puppeteer**: For more reliable scraping, use Puppeteer/Playwright locally
3. **API Discovery**: Monitor network requests to find Pulppo's internal API endpoints

### Long Term
1. **Reverse Engineer API**: Pulppo likely has an internal API that could be accessed directly
2. **Partnership**: Consider reaching out to Pulppo for official API access
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Use EasyBroker for reliable data, supplement with Pulppo when possible

## Cost Analysis
- Scrape.do can access Pulppo without issues
- No need for expensive proxy services
- Lower cost compared to sites with Cloudflare protection

## Next Steps
1. Test the current implementation with real searches
2. Monitor how many properties are successfully extracted
3. Implement retry logic for cases where properties don't load
4. Consider implementing a headless browser solution for better reliability
